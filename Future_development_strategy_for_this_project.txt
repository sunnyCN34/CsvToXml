                                 Future Strategies for this Project

Things I would like to do with this project in future would be:

•	Instead of serializing java objects into XML with XStream library.
    I would like to use XSLT to convert our data into XML.
    This would give us more control over the functionality of
    project and we can write something more customized.

•	Also, one other strategy to futher develop this project would
    be to use a framework like Spring to do the development which will
    be more suited when we work on enterprise scale and will make our
    project more robust and scalable.
